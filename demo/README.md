# Capstone Project

My Java Spring application is about managing events in variety of sports.

Front part looks like this: Application asks for users to identify themselves. User can either signup or register onto the site (In both cases they must enter both username and password but this could be further extended by asking user to also enter email address during registration for security messures). After signing up or registering, users will be authorized and directed to the home screen of the application where they can:
- Create players
- Create teams
- Create events
- See created Players
- See created teams
- See created events
- Visit "How to" for user guidelines (optional)

Events are basically tournaments in which 2 opposing teams fight for victory.

When creating players, users must put player's first-name and last-name. Then if users want to assign this player to certain team, they must also enter that team which they want to assign player to and the player's number which will indicate on which position that player will play.

When creating teams, users must set team's name upon which they can add players to the team.

When creating events, users must set the name of the event, 2 opposing teams and the starting date and time for the event.

During the process of the event users can Pause/Resume the game should the game's rules be violated and set points for each team and at the end of the game announce the winner team with most points.
